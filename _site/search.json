Project Overview\r\nIn Engagement, Ohio, the future is now! For years this sleepy bedroom\r\ncommunity was a secret gem in the heart of the state. But now the word\r\nis out and the people are running, not walking, to buy up their claim on\r\nthis bit of paradise!\r\nAnticipating rapid growth, the city of Engagement, Ohio USA is doing\r\na participatory urban planning exercise to understand the current state\r\nof the city and identify opportunities for future growth. About 1000\r\nrepresentative residents in this modest-sized city have agreed to\r\nprovide data using the city’s urban planning app, which records the\r\nplaces they visit, their spending, and their purchases, among other\r\nthings. From these volunteers, the city will have data to assist with\r\ntheir major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate\r\na very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\r\nIn this project, based on VAST Challenge\r\n2022, we decide to dig into the economic situation of the\r\nEngagement city.\r\n2. Data Source\r\nDatasets were obtained from the VAST Challenge 2022 official website\r\nin csv format. Datasets required for this challenge are including, but\r\nnot limited to:\r\nParticipants.csv\r\nFinancialJournal.csv\r\nPubs.csv\r\nRestaurants.csv\r\nCheckinJournal.csv\r\n3. Methodology\r\nThe following are the packages required for this challenge, including\r\nbut not limited to:\r\ntidyverse: are designed to work together to make common data\r\nscience operations more user friendly. The packages have functions for\r\ndata wrangling, tidying, reading/writing, parsing, and visualizing,\r\namong others.\r\nlubridate: fast and user friendly parsing of date-time data,\r\nextraction and updating of components of a date-time (years, months,\r\ndays, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time\r\nand time-span objects\r\nggiraph: a tool that allows you to create dynamic ggplot graphs.\r\nThis allows you to add tooltips, hover effects and JavaScript actions to\r\nthe graphics. The package also allows the selection of graphical\r\nelements when used in shiny applications.\r\ngganimate: extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by\r\nggplot2 to include the description of animation.\r\nggstatsplot: to provide statistical details\r\n4.
